# An Extensible Possible Worlds Explorer for Answer Set Programming

### To Get Started (using venv):

1. Install clingo. PW_explorer has been tested with clingo version: 5.2.1

2. ```python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment```

3. ```source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate```

4. ```python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ PW_explorer```

To deactivate the virtualenv after you're done working:

5. ```deactivate```

Repeat Step 3 to resume work and Step 5 to exit the virtualenv again.

Installing PW_explorer will install all the modules within PW_explorer along with all their dependencies. It will also install the following Command Line Tools in /usr/bin/ :

1. run_clingo
2. load_worlds
3. dist_calc
4. complexity_calc
5. visualize
6. pwe_export
7. pwe_query

The above CLI tools leverage the installed PW_explorer modules.

### General Workflow:

```                                           
                                            generate clingo outputs 
                                                       ⏬
                                                      parse 
                                                       ⏬
                                          export to formats such as sql
                                                       ⏬

                                                       ⏬
                                               distance calculation 
                                                       ⏬
                                                complexity analysis
                                                       ⏬
